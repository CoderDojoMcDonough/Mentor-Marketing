**Background Checks**

After a recent agreement, Dojo without 501c3 status will still be able to avail of this partnership. 

 the CoderDojo Foundation have negotiated a partnership with Verified Volunteers for helping US Dojos to get volunteers background checked! Child Protection is a massive priority for the global CoderDojo community and this partnership came about after other US Dojos had worked with Verified Volunteers and suggested we start a conversation. 

If you would like to find out more about the partnership, rates and see the success other Dojos have had using Verified Volunteers in the past please check out [here>>>](http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Background_Checking_US) for more information. 

While the arranged partnership is not offering completely free background checking there are heavily discounted rates available and we would encourage, where possible, for all Dojos to look into getting their volunteers background checked. 

If you would like to work with Verified Volunteers to get your volunteers background checked please contact:
